## What the Application Shows

**Key Metrics** - optimal cement ratio and maximum strength values

**Strength Charts** - 4 diagrams showing all characteristics

**Comparative Analysis** - line graphs comparing different strength types

**Water-Binder Ratio** - dependency on cement ratio

**Data Tables** - original experimental data

**Automatic Conclusions** - confirmation that 80% cement is optimal
